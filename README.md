# VigenereBreaker
The Vigenere Cipher was used in previous times to code a secret message(You can google about that for more info ). This program decodes a message coded with Vigenere Cipher to different languages.

P.S. : 1. To run this code you'll need to clone the repository along with the libraries and the data files.
       2. It uses a custom edu.duke library for using FilesResource and DirectoryResource classes to take input from files.
       3. You will have to select all the files from the dictionary folder when the dialouge box appears.(will fix this soon)
       4. By default the file with coded message is "athens.txt".
       5. You can check the coded msg by checking the above mentioned file.
       6. The output for decoded message in different messages will be visible in the console of your IDE.
